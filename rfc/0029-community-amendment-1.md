# Summary

This document exists to amend and update the definitions and processes defined in 
[RFC 7: Community Team](/rfc/0007-community-team.md). It addresses some shortcomings in the Community Team's governance
and structure that have become apparent over the first few months since the community Discord server became open to the
public.

## Changes

A summary of the changes made within this amendment follows:

* Keyholders are explicitly no longer members of the Community Team, but they're still welcome to oversee the community
  team's decisions and processes and provide feedback and insight if they wish. This also means they're no longer
  considered to be voting members.
* It's no longer required that all Community Team members are moderators. While the majority of the Community Team
  should be moderation and management staff, there's also room for event managers, organisational supports, and so on.
* Trainee Community Moderators have been defined, and new Community Moderators must go through a training period before 
  they can graduate and become Community Moderators. Trainee Community Moderators do not vote on internal polls, and
  are not expected to handle difficult situations.
* The process for handling internal votes has been separated out from the rest of the processes and standardized. This
  allows for a consistent voting process regardless of what's being voted on, while still allowing for extra closing,
  failing and passing conditions as required. Failing conditions also override passing conditions, instead of the other
  way around.
* The voting process now takes abstentions into account, both explicitly (where the voting member states they're 
  abstaining) and implicitly (where the voting member simply doesn't vote).
* Admins are no longer considered to be voting members unless they're part of the Community Team, or consensus for a
  vote cannot be reached. 
* For Community Team elections, the interview now comes before the vote, rather than the other way around.
* A new process to be followed when existing Community Team members wish to switch their role or take on new roles has
  been written.

# Explanation

The Community Team will be in charge of maintaining the Quilt community spaces, as detailed in the summary. It will
be responsible for drafting up, accepting comments on and implementing community policies, interacting with and
protecting the community and its members, and resolving conflicts and enforcing the community policies. Community Team
members also play a large role when it comes to community engagement, and team members should be prepared to plan
events and generally engage with the community when possible.

## Keyholders

While Quilt is a community project with concerns split across different teams, Discord (and some other platforms) is
designed with the core idea of a single community leader or owner in mind. For that reason, platforms that cannot be
run explicitly under team leadership alone must be "owned" by a keyholder.

A keyholder is a democratically elected member of the community that otherwise has no direct involvement or stake
in the management of the community. By electing an otherwise unrelated party to be a keyholder, it's hoped that the
Quilt community spaces can avoid the issue of a community leader gone rogue - it should prevent an abuse of power from
giving someone total control over any community space, at least as far as is possible.

After they've been elected, a keyholder does not need to be otherwise active in the community. All that's required of
them is that they're easily contactable (within reason), and that they're prepared to act in the event that something
happens that they will need to take care of.

Keyholder candidates should:

* Be able to show that they have no conflicting interests or personal wish to be in power
* Be known to a majority of the Community Team
* Have a clean, positive reputation in the Quilt community and wider modding community
* Have some accreditation or other guarantee of reputation in the wider modding community
* Regarding Discord specifically, they should be prepared to act as a liaison with the Discord team and to represent
  the Quilt community officially when interacting with them, including in the event of a partnership or working
  relationship with Discord
* Understand what's involved with keyholding, and be ready to step in when needed

Keyholders are not members of the Community Team, and they are not required to be obvious in the communities they
keyhold for - but they are free to make themselves known if they wish. They're also welcome to oversee the community 
team in their actions and processes, and provide opinions and feedback if they wish.

## Basic Responsibilities

All members of the Community Team have the following responsibilities:

* To represent the Quilt project in an honest and respectful manner, and serve as an example of good behaviour in
  community spaces
* To participate in the processes that shape the Community Team, including voting on new team members and structural
  changes to community spaces (unless they're a Trainee Community Moderator - see below)
* To engage with the community authentically, being present and visible in the community when able and appropriate
* To be supportive of other Community Team members, providing insight, advice and support when able and appropriate
* To help with the planning and running of community events and projects, when able and appropriate

All team roles are additive - they add additional responsibilities on top of this basic set.

## Team Roles

Community Team members may have specific roles, which define additional responsibilities (and additional tools to meet
those responsibilities) on top of their basic responsibilities, as defined above. While the roles are intended to be 
fairly balanced regarding their responsibilities, there is still likely to be some overlap - for example, Community
Managers also have the *ability* to moderate, if they're required to.

The role structure is intended to be flat, rather than an explicit hierarchy. Roles represent tasks and
responsibilities, rather than seniority. Roles may be assigned based on a number of criteria, including:

* Previous experience
* Staffing shortfalls or situational needs
* Suitability for the role
* Types of work the team member is offering to handle

### Community Managers

Community managers are responsible for day-to-day administrative tasks in Quilt community spaces, and take an active
role in the Community Team candidacy process. They're in charge of mobilizing and supporting the rest of the community
team, maintaining community spaces, and keeping everything running smoothly. Responsibilities include:

* Actioning changes to the structure of community spaces, or to community policies
* Aiding in conflict resolution and decision-making, especially when it comes to difficult moderation decisions
* Engaging with the community when they have questions, reports or issues, and working with them to address their
  concerns
* Facilitating the Community Team candidacy process by helping other team members to set up polls, and conducting
  interviews
* Maintaining informational channels, and writing and posting community-oriented announcements
* Managing any bots or other community-relevant automation tools
* Organising, training and supporting the moderation team, and acting as supplemental moderators as required
* Supporting the rest of the Community Team in their work, providing them with the tools and changes to community 
  spaces that they need

Community managers must be appointed democratically, following the process outlined later in this document. If
required, the keyholders will handle handing out the permissions required for community managers to work in Quilt
community spaces.

### Community Moderators

Community Moderators are responsible for maintaining the safety and welfare of the members of the Quilt community by
enforcing the community policies, aiding in conflict resolution and dealing with problematic users and behaviours.
Responsibilities include:

* Aiding in conflict resolution between community members, and de-escalating heated situations
* Applying infractions for problematic behaviour or removing problematic users - in accordance with the community
  policies
* Collaborating with other Community Team members to ensure the smooth running of the community, and to ensure that due
  process is followed - in accordance with the community policies
* Engaging in active, honest participation in the Quilt community
* Engaging in the Community Team's democratic processes
* Helping members to find the correct community space for their query, and ensuring that other members don't prevent
  them from getting the support they need
* Keeping up to date on social issues (especially those that affect minority groups), and applying that knowledge to
  keep community members safe

Community Moderators must be appointed after a training period of no less than one week, graduating from their position
of Trainee Community Moderator after a review of their performance by the rest of the Community Team.

### Trainee Community Moderators

Trainee Community Moderators are new moderators that have been appointed as part of the process for electing team
members. They have a similar set of responsibilities to Community Moderators, and are "in training" - with oversight
and support provided by the rest of the Community Team.

The intention of this position is to provide new moderators with a buffer period, where they can feel more comfortable
seeking help and support from the rest of the Community Team. They're also publicly differentiated from the rest of
the moderation team, to ensure that community members understand that they're in-training and may make mistakes.
Trainee Community Moderators are expected to lean on the rest of the team, and to incorporate feedback given to them.
There is no requirement that they handle situations they're unsure about, or to make difficult decisions - these are
responsibilities assigned to Community Moderators and Community Managers.

Trainee Community Moderators should be excluded from the voting process until they graduate.

Trainee Community Moderators must spend at least one week in this position before they can be promoted to Community
Moderator, pending a review of their performance and discussion by the rest of the Community Team. Trainee Community
Moderators must be appointed democratically, following the process outlined later on in this document.

## Process: Voting on Changes

As Quilt is a community-run project and seeks to avoid the problems that come with single or small groups of people with
the very last, final say on everything, the Community Team implements a democratic approach for much of its processes.
This is detailed in this section - all other processes that involve votes should follow this process, unless otherwise
specified.

### Admin Board Members

Unless they're also a voting member of the Community Team, members of the Quilt Admin Board do note vote on internal
polls by default. Instead, they should only vote in order to break ties or contribute to inconclusive polls - votes
provided by members of the admin board are tripled, meaning that **one vote becomes three** - this is detailed in
[RFC 6: Governmental Structure](/community/0006-governance.md), as the admin board is the only parent of the community
team.

### Trainee Community Moderators

Trainee Community Moderators are not voting members of the Community Team, and should not be considered for internal 
votes. This is to ensure that all voters have had some time to get familiar with the community and how it's run - but
non-voting members of the Community Team are always welcome to express their opinions and provide insight if they wish 
to.

### Voting Process

1. The Community Team needs to discuss the subject matter of the vote beforehand, and discern whether a vote should
   take place to begin with - if it's decided that a vote will surely fail, then no vote is required and the motion
   can be dismissed immediately.
1. A poll is created in an internal channel that's designated for that purpose, either by posting a simple message or
   via a bot designed to facilitate polling. This poll should provide as much detail as possible, either directly in
   the poll message or by providing links and references - but it must be clear and not misleading, and the core idea
   must be present in the message instead of in the references.
   
   Polls must also include a closing date of no less than one day and longer than one week, regardless of the proposal 
   put forward.
1. Members of the Community Team may vote on the poll using the provided reactions. All polls should include a positive
   and negative option, as well as the option to abstain. Voting members that abstain are excluded from percentages and
   tallies.
1. Voting members are not required to explicitly explain their votes - major problems with the proposal should be 
   worked out before the vote even begins, to avoid putting particular community members on the spot.

### Closing Votes

Voting ends when any of the following conditions have been reached:

* The poll's closing date has been reached
* The poll has failed or passed early due to at least 75% of the voting members of the Community Team voting in that
  direction, excluding abstaining members from that count
* The special closing conditions specified as part of the specific process that this vote is part of have been met, if
  any

### Interpreting the Vote

When a poll has closed, the votes should be inspected. If the final vote has a margin of three votes or fewer, 
non-voting members of the administrative board must be invited to vote on the poll, with their votes counting for 
three. They are not required to vote if they don't feel they need to, however.

If any voting members of the Community Team don't vote on the poll (unintentionally or otherwise), their vote **must be
counted as an abstention.**

The Community Team should then tally the final vote counts, and interpret them as follows.

#### Failing conditions

The vote has failed when one of the following is true:

* The total number of _abstentions_ **is greater than or equal to** 25% of the count of voting members of the community 
  team, rounding up to the nearest whole number
* The total number of _negative_ votes **is greater than or equal to** the number of _positive_ votes
* The special failing conditions specified as part of the specific process that this vote is part of have been met, if
  any

#### Passing conditions

The vote has passed when one of the following is true, but only if no failing condition has been met:

* The total number of _positive_ votes **is greater than** the number of _negative_ votes
* The special passing conditions specified as part of the specific process that this vote is part of have been met, if
  any

#### Other situations

As detailed above, there should be no situations where a vote ends in a tie. If a situation arises that the voting
process is unable to cover, the vote will fail and will need to be re-tried when the process has been amended.

## Process: Electing Team Members

As our primary communication space is the official Discord server, Community Team member appointments should be
processed on Discord. Quilt's Community Team members are elected using a democratic internal process:

1. Members of Quilt community spaces may apply to join the community by contacting the Community Team directly. The
   preferred contact method for this is by making use of the ModMail system on Discord.
   
   * Alternatively, candidates may be put forward by other members of the Community Team, after some internal 
     discussion. This may be a result of observations made by the Community Team, suggestions from community members,
     or otherwise - but the Community Team should always discuss before putting forward a candidate, and they should
     ensure that the candidate is actually interested in the position they're being put forward for.
1. Candidates must be interviewed by a Community Manager before the election process can continue. All voting members
   of the Community Team should be given access to the interview space, and other voting members of the Community Team
   are welcome to give their opinions on the content of the interview, or present their own questions after the
   Community Manager giving the interview opens the floor to them.
1. After an interview has taken place, a vote should be proposed, following the voting process outlined earlier in this
   document. This poll should last for exactly one week, with the following special conditions:
   
   * The vote has **failed** when:
     * The margin between positive and negative votes is less than or equal to 20% of the number of voting community
       members, excluding abstentions and rounding up to the nearest whole number.
       
   The poll should include the user's history in the community and their reputation in the wider modding community, if
   known. It should also include the specific position they're applying for.
1. Once the vote has closed, the candidate should be contacted by a community manager and given the result, which will
   decide whether their application was successful.
   
   * If the vote (and thus application) has failed, the candidate should be given feedback on their interview and
     any actionable concerns should be provided. Candidates with failed applications should not be excluded from
     applying again, but their next application should be at least a month after their previous one.
   
   * If the vote (and thus application) has passed, the Community Manager overseeing the application must provide the
     applicant with any documentation they need, ensure they're ready to join the Community Team now, and provide them
     with any roles and access that their new position requires. The Community Manager should also help the new
     community manager to settle into their position, support and train them as necessary, introduce them to the
     development teams, announce their appointment to the community, and provide information on the structure of the
     internal communications channels.

**Remember:** If the candidate is applying for a moderation-related role, they must always go through a training
period as a Trainee Community Moderator. This is required for all Community Moderator and Community Manager positions,
but is not required for positions without enforcement duties, such as event organisers.

## Process: Changing/Adding Roles

Each Community Team member has a specific set of responsibilities and tasks to keep in mind. These are assigned based
on the role they currently occupy, but there's no reason for any Community Team member to be unable to move between
roles later on if they wish, or take on additional responsibility if they're able.

Any Community Team member wishing to change their role or take on another role must go through the election process
for that role again. A special ModMail thread must be created - which they must not be able to access from the internal
interface - and the interview process should continue as normal from there.

Voting should be handled as detailed in the election process above, but the Community Team member in question should not
be counted in the voting tallies or percentage of voters. If the Community Team is applying for a moderation-related
role - and they haven't gone through the Trainee Community Moderator process - they must always go through a training
period as a Trainee Community Moderator.

Community Team members switching roles or taking on additional roles must not be treated preferentially to any other
types of candidates. It's important, therefore, that the rest of the community team holds its members accountable
during this process.

### Points to Consider

Voters (and those that are considering putting forward a candidate) should consider the following points when forming
their opinion:

* Does the candidate actually want to join the Community Team?
* Does the candidate have a good understanding of the Quilt community policies?
* Does the candidate have any known problematic behaviour outside the Quilt community?
* How active is the candidate in the Quilt community?
* How does the candidate choose to interact with other community members? How do they interact with the Community Team
  in comparison?
* How does the community perceive the candidate? Do they mesh well with the rest of the community?
* How has the candidate contributed to the Quilt community and project so far?
* How well does the candidate fit into the Quilt community's culture?
* What is the candidate's infraction history? Have they been infracted for anything serious?
* Would any community members be uncomfortable if the candidate were to be elected? If so, why?

Of course, there are likely to be additional considerations to keep in mind - voters should always bring up anything
that concerns them about an applicant, and criticisms are not limited to the above list.
